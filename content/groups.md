## Messy Church {#messy-church}
_St Peter's, Waipawa_

Our Messy Church is one of over 3800 Messy Churches in 29 countries around the world. Our first session was in April 2015. Messy Church is "all age" and everyone is welcome (although children must be accompanied by an adult (i.e., parent, grandparent or other adult relative or caregiver).

> Messy Church is Church for everyone!

Messy Church is part of a world wide expression of Church that focuses on:
* Hospitality: we have a meal together
* Being Christ Centred: we share our Christian Faith
* Creativity: we do lots of messy creative things
* Celebration: we love music and celebrating all part of life together
* All Ages: we don't divide people up; we do things together.

## St Mary's Fellowship Group {#fellowship}

The St Mary's Fellowship group focuses on the needs of our local community in whatever way we can: such as knitting, baking, raising funds for worthy causes and caring for one another.

St Mary's Family Fellowship group meets in the Naera Lounge in St Mary's Hall at 1.30pm on the 3rd Tuesday of each month. 

We have a membership of 18 church-based women, but would love to see more people join us.

Our group is informal. Sometimes we have a speaker, sometimes an outing, other times an activity, a quiz or just a chat. Meetings are always followed by an afternoon tea organised by the committee member on duty for the day. 

If you are interested in St Mary's Family Fellowship group, please come along to a meeting held in the Naera Lounge.
