## Messy Church {#messy-church}
_St Peter's, Waipawa_

Our Messy Church is one of over 3800 Messy Churches in 29 countries around the world. Our first session was in April 2015. Messy Church is "all age" and everyone is welcome (although children must be accompanied by an adult (i.e., parent, grandparent or other adult relative or caregiver).

> Messy Church is Church for everyone!

Messy Church is part of a world wide expression of Church that focuses on:
* Hospitality: we have a meal together
* Being Christ Centred: we share our Christian Faith
* Creativity: we do lots of messy creative things
* Celebration: we love music and celebrating all part of life together
* All Ages: we don't divide people up; we do things together.
