> God who brings life to creation and to people, help us to see you at work in Central Hawke's Bay and to work with you so your kingdom grows here. By the grace of your Spirit, be the source of our love, our energy and our songs so that, separately and together, we may draw closer to you. May we speak of you and share your life with people who live, work and visit here, bringing glory to your name through Jesus Christ our Lord and in the power of the Spirit. Amen.

We believe that human beings are created to glorify and adore God. In worship we are most fully human; we live in that relationship of love with God who is love; we receive his life.

At all of our churches in Central Hawke's Bay Parish our aim is to provide worship that brings everyone into God's presence. Some of our services are more suitable for children, some are more suitable for those who want a quiet atmosphere, but everyone is always welcome.

The Eucharist is at the centre of our life together. Through it we encounter Jesus present in the reading of scripture, in the bread and wine of communion and in one another, because together we are the Body of Christ.
