### Farewell to our Vicar Joan

The Central Hawke's Bay Anglican Parish community warmly invites you to join us as we farewell our wonderful Vicar Joan and her husband Andrew.

Join us in service at St Mary's Church, Waipukurau on 29th October at 2:00pm.

The service will be followed by an afternoon tea in the hall and later (at 6:00pm) a BYO finger food and drinks at the Vicarage.
