## Diocesan Contacts {#diocesan}
### Who can you talk to?
The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia has clear professional standards for how ministry is carried out by people in the church leadership positions, whether lay or ordained.

Our church has a clear, easily accessible and confidential procedure to deal with any concerns about unprofessional behaviour from a lay or ordained leader, including abuse, bullying, sexual misconduct or any misuse of power.

If you would like to discuss any past or present concern in confidence, please get in touch with the Diocesan contact people for Hawke's Bay listed below.
