Welcome to our Parish, which extends over a large geographical area in Central Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, from the coast out to the ranges. It is served by a number of historic churches, all working together as one Parish. In worship and in service we aim to bring together people of all ages to worship God, grow together and serve God's world.

## Our Mission {#mission}
We are communities on a journey, discovering what it is to be God's people and responding to God who is love and who gives us life. We seek to be inclusive, valuing the experiences and gifts of all. Our worship is normally centred on _A New Zealand Prayer Book—He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa_, though each faith community explores different ways of worshipping and connecting with the wider communities in which they are based.

<hr>

## Our History {#history}
Central Hawke's Bay Parish was created in October 2015—an amalgamation of the parishes of Waipawa, Waipukurau, Takapau and Porangahau. These now four distinct faith communities within our parish. Each retains its unique identity while sharing in the wider life of the Parish.

## Our Churches {#churches}
Our main churches are in Takapau, Waipukurau and Waipawa and we have several others in our smaller communities. Many of these churches are open for you to rest, think and pray. We look forward to meeting you.
