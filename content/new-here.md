If you are new to Central Hawke's Bay, welcome; if you come to one of our [services](/services) or other [events](/news) at any of our churches in the Parish, you can expect a warm welcome and, often, something to eat and drink. We run a range of services and at all of them we aim to be friendly and not too formal.

Our church family includes all ages—from young children through to people in their nineties—which reflects the diverse population of our Parish. Some people have lived in Central Hawke's Bay most, if not all, of their lives, whilst others have moved here very recently.

Again, we welcome you to our Parish, and look forward to meeting you soon.
